# Kentico Extensions

In a nutshell, Kentico Extensions extends the UI and functionality of Kentico using JavaScript.

Note that Kentico Extensions was not developed by, nor has any affiliation with Kentico the company.

A picture is worth a thousand words, so here is an example of a Kentico Extension

## Environment Bar

The environment bar adds a colored line and label to the top of Kentico to easily identify between different environments.

The colours also allow you to identify different environments within the task tray.

## Shortcuts Bar

The shortcuts bar adds your dashboard items to a navigation bar in the header. By holding down Ctrl and clicking items, you easily navigate to your most used applications in new tabs.

The items on the shortcuts bar are based on the tiles on your dashboard.

If the shortcuts bar is covering information in the header, it can easily be collapsed and expanded.

**These are just two exmaples, but Kentico Extensions can do much much more**
